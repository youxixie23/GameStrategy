      <div id="content"><!--ä¸“é¢˜å†…å®¹å¼€å§‹-->1: The Beginning <br />"A twinkling consciousness became a star which sparkled in the night and <br />banished the darkness. The Mana Goddess acquired consciousness by gazing into <br />the light of that sun. She made Fa'Diel, a great land, but so far an empty one."<br /><br />2: The Moon Gods <br />"The Mana Goddess drew beams of six colors from the sun. They became the six <br />moons, each hiding a small deity within. When those gods awoke, they played <br />beautiful music and brought fortune to the land of Fa'Diel." <br /><br />3: The Names of Stones <br />"The six deities became the Moon Gods and demanded that the Mana Goddess name <br />them. So the Mana Goddess gave each of them a shining stone, which filled the <br />air with music: Stars, follow me! Moons, walk with me! And we shall celebrate <br />your names!" <br /><br />4: The Moon's Names <br />"Tryne, merciful god of water. <br />Zea, passionate god of fire. <br />Barlen, selfish god of gold. <br />Libleyt, hopeful god of wood. <br />Morphes, wealthy god of earth. <br />Ghazel, whimsical god of wind. <br />The Moon Gods rejoiced, and the Mana Goddess returned to her slumber, becoming <br />the great Mana Tree. Fa'Diel was left to the whims of the Moon Gods." <br /><br />5: The Creation <br />"The Moon Gods created land and ocean, trees and flowers, and gave them light <br />and the power to determine their fate. The light became the Elemental Spirits, <br />riding in the sky. They released bountiful light, and were full of desire to <br />serve the Moon Gods' will. The Moon Gods then finally returned to slumber." <br /><br />6: Flammies <br />"Then, a beautiful yet powerful beast appeared, awakening the Moon Gods. The <br />Moon Gods named this beast of strength and beauty Flammy. Whenever one of the <br />Moon Gods would fall asleep, another Flammy would appear. Eventually, Flammies <br />of all six colors came to populate all the land." <br /><br />7: Dark Clouds <br />"The Moon Gods tried to outdo each other in creating beauty. Sometimes they <br />argued trying follow the Mana Goddess's will and create many beasts. But dark <br />clouds came to Fa'Diel, and the Moon Gods created greater beasts, and set them <br />loose upon the land. The Flammies often quarreled, and the cycle of creation and <br />destruction repeated endlessly." <br /><br />8: The Hole <br />"The trees withered, and the Elemental Spirits lost their luster. The land dried <br />up, and soon thereafter, wars began. As the wars dragged on, the powers of the <br />Moon Gods were lost. The land of Fa'Diel was scarred, and pits to other worlds <br />opened in the wounds. The Moon Gods peeked into the other world, and came to <br />know fear, envy, and desire." <br /><br />9: Rebirth <br />"Cracks appeared in the Mana Tree. Waves of chaos from other worlds came and <br />tried to envelop all of Fa'Diel. Each Moon God chose a Flammy and gave it a <br />stone. The Flammies rode into the sky. They were born of the earth to ride in <br />the sky and return to the earth. They became a flying river of Mana." <br /><br />10: The Thoughts <br />"Fa'Diel was filled with the power of Mana. It healed itself and shut away the <br />other world. The Flammies returned to the Moon Gods, but could not find them. <br />The Moon Gods had lost their memories and became beasts. The six remaining <br />Flammies cried in anguish and despair. The waves in the air settled, and created <br />many thought forms." <br /><br />11: The Revelation <br />"The Flammies turned their backs on the Moon Gods and flew into the air. The <br />Moon Gods turned into stars, and the Flammies never came back down. New concepts <br />came about after the Flammies and the Moon Gods departed, but the Elemental <br />Spirits were afraid and prayed to the Mana Tree, who responded with soft <br />pulses." <br /><br />12: The Prophecy <br />"These formless beings will eventually be given form so that they might live. <br />They will be given the task of creating this world. The thoughts they think will <br />shape the landscape. They will be born into this world in fear and sadness. <br />Sometimes their thoughts may hurt this world, but you must help them build it." <br /><br />13: Man and Faerie <br />"Soon many new beings were born, such as men and Faeries. Man used Mana to power <br />his creations. Faeries amplified the power of Mana with song and dance. Then, <br />from beyond the heavens, six colored beams of light shown down upon the land. <br />Six Flammies gazed upon Fa'Diel, and all life there prospered. A new age had <br />begun." <br /><br />14: The Dark One <br />"The Flammies of legend never returned from their heavenly climb. Below, many <br />similar creatures came into being. For example, dragons reflected the Flammies' <br />divinity, become a race of depp introspection. They took it upon themselves to <br />protect Fa'Diel from its many foes." <br /><br />15: The Fallen <br />"Wyrms are rumored to be Flammies who have fallen into another world. Powerful <br />mages summoned them into this world. Wyrms possess the incredible powers of the <br />Flammies, but they lack their nobility and grandeur. True Flammies are said to <br />appear regal and divine, unlike dragons and wyrms, but no man can truthfully <br />claim to have seen them." <br /><br />16: The Work of Man <br />"Humans were destined to reproduce and populate the land, and they developed the <br />technology to build. Soon they gained dominance over all physical things. The <br />humans who live in this world come in different forms, but they are all humans. <br />Some inherit their forms from their parents, while others are shaped through <br />their experiences." <br /><br />17: The Work of Faerie <br />"Faeries have transparent wings, which are not used for flying, and are shed <br />during growth. Only young Faeries are visible to humans, and their bodies fade <br />as time goes on. Eventually, they become completely invisible to the human eye." <br /><br />18: The Mana Tree <br />"The Mana Tree sustained the bond between the world of humans and of Faeries. <br />Plants exist in both the human and Faerie dimensions. They absorb the Mana of <br />Fa'Diel and release it into the atmosphere. Humans use trees for fuel and tools, <br />harnessing their power within inanimate objects. Faeries use the Mana released <br />by plants to make Fa'Diel a better place." <br /><br />19: Sorcerers <br />"Although not on par with the Faeries, all humans could once harness the power <br />of Mana. The ability to draw on the power of Mana was originally given to all <br />humans equally, but many lost that ability by relying on machines, and losing <br />touch with the natural world. Later, those with the power to draw Mana were <br />called mages." <br /><br />20: Anise <br />"The Great Witch Anise was the first mage to go down in history. Anis bored a <br />hole into the Mana Tree and built her laboratory there. The flow of Mana into <br />both human and Faerie worlds was diverted. Anise constructed a jewel called the <br />Eye of Flame using the vast amounts of Mana in her laboratory. The Firestone <br />brought out the evil of whoever touched it." <br /><br />21: Unknown Stones <br />"In the Age of Myth, the stones that the Mana Goddess gave to the Moon Gods were <br />the most powerful source of magic known. However, some powerful magic users born <br />in later ages possessed similar stones. Anise tried to obtain such a stone when <br />she created the Eye of Flame, but it was difficult to control, and very <br />dangerous." <br /><br />22: Golden Age Ends <br />"Soon, many others learned how to construct their own Eyes of Flame. The waves <br />of Mana became chaotic, and shadows clouded the hearts of man. These pulses tore <br />rifts within dimensions and sent waves of evil into the hearts of man. No longer <br />was all life on the planet descended from the spirits. An age had ended. A world <br />had fallen from its original purity." <br /><br />23: Uraklius Aeon <br />"Evil ruled the land thereafter through men who could control the waves of chaos. <br />Those of truth cried in anguish, but mages, who rejoiced in obtaining new powers, <br />firmly believed that this was the world they wanted. The mages declared the <br />beginning of a new thousand-year kingdom and called it the Aeon of Uraklius." <br /><br />24: The Holy War <br />"Aion, the leader of the Faeries, sent an army to conquer Anise. There, hundreds <br />of Anise's mages battled thousands of Faerie warriors. The battle was fought <br />overnight, and almost all of the Faeries were slain. The few remaining Faeries <br />continued their lives in the land of men." <br /><br />25: The Hidden <br />"Although the Faeries thought that all humans were enemies, they soon discovered <br />that there were those in the land of men who could understand the Faeries. With <br />the help of the humans, they were again able to battle Anise and her mages. <br />Eventually they rose victorious. Unfortunately, during the fight, the Mana Tree <br />burned to the ground." <br /><br />26: Eyes of Flame <br />"Although it was thought that many Eyes of Flame would be recovered from the <br />ashes, only three were found. Aion was banished to the Underworld. He refused to <br />be reincarnated, and became the Lord of the Underworld." <br /><br />27: The Underworld <br />"Aion, leader of the Faeries, created his new servants, the Shadoles. Shadoles <br />were born from the thoughts of Aion, and they brought the newly departed to the <br />Underworld. From this time on, all departed souls are brought to the Underworld <br />to receive the judgement of its Lord." <br /><br />28: Seventh Moon <br />"Anise was killed by a stone called the "Seventh Moon." Legend has it that the <br />Faerie warrior who fought against Anise, a master of the Eye of Flame in her own <br />right, bested her using this mysterious object." <br /><br />29: A Brief Peace <br />"After the Holy War of the Mana Tree, the flow of Mana to the world resumed. <br />Before, mages would steal from others, using dangerous magic, but now the land <br />produced enough for all. However, the surviving mages could not stand being <br />equal to their fellow creatures. They sought magic that could make everything <br />their own." <br /><br />30: Mages' Tower <br />"The mages started building towers at Mana Points all over Fa'Diel in order to <br />regain the Eyes of Flame. They took action against the Faeries, who stood in the <br />way of their plans. Whenever a tower was built, an army would come to destroy it. <br />Such wars continued for hundreds of years. Soon, all of humanity came to think <br />of Faeries as evil beings." <br /><br />31: Mountain School <br />"Elise, who called herself Anuella, was the daughter of Anise. She had the power <br />to bring mundane objects to life. After fleeing her mother's self-righteous rule, <br />she settled in the northern mountains and there created a group of dolls who <br />would obey her every command. They came to be called magical beings, and her art <br />was promulgated by mages who idolized her." <br /><br />32: Artificers <br />"There were two types of magical beings. One type was imbued with life. Another <br />type had hidden powers. The latter were called artifacts. Artifacts had weaker <br />magical powers than Eyes of Flame, but were simpler to construct. Creating Eyes <br />of Flame was frought with accidents, so making artifacts became the most popular <br />kind of magic." <br /><br />33: Argot <br />"The king of dragons, Argot, destroyed all the mage towers in the land of <br />Faeries. Argot opened a hole into the other worlds and called forth many <br />monsters. However, records state that he eventually turned to evil, and was <br />banished by the Faeries." <br /><br />34: Lucemia <br />"Argot summoned a wyrm in the shape of a Flammy. He summoned Lucemia, the Wyrm <br />of Light, and the greatest of all the wyrms. Legends says that Lucemia leveled <br />each and every mage tower, and died trying to swallow an entire volcano." <br /><br />35: The Lilipeas <br />"The Lilipeas are a small tribe that settled in the northern mountains. People <br />said that they were similar to Anuella's dolls. Only Selva, who was tall and <br />slim, oft visited Anuella by riding on a bird. Selva often took Anuella's dolls <br />outside." <br /><br />36: The Ashes <br />"In a charcoal-maker's hut, a little girl awaited her father's return. Her name <br />was Magnolia, and her father made a living from hunting and from making charcoal. <br />Selva gave this girl one of Anuella's dolls." <br /><br />37: Anise's Fire <br />"The doll that was brought into Magnolia's room had red stones as its eyes. They <br />were the Eyes of Flame that Anise made, and they burst into flames and burned <br />the hut to ashes." <br /><br />38: Mage and Ruby <br />"Magnolia lost her life in the hut as it burned down, but the doll was saved. <br />The doll began to call herself Magnolia, and she stayed with the Lilipeas, until <br />one day she left with a mage. The mage wanted to steal the Eyes of Flame in <br />Magnolia's eyes, for they contained more Mana energy than the enchanted <br />instruments." <br /><br />39: Gaeus <br />"Anuella saw through the mage's plot. She left the northern mountain, then gave <br />life to a rocky hill so the mage's caravan could not progress further. The <br />living hill called itself Gaeus, and its knowledge seemed deeper, and more vast <br />than Anuella's. Anuella called for Gaeus' help and prepared for war." <br /><br />40: The Conductor <br />"All the Faeries fought on Anuella's side, using many enchanted instruments. The <br />mage's force fell apart against the power of the instruments with infinite Mana <br />power. Anuella came to be known as the "player of the Flying Contravass," and as <br />"the Conductor" among Faeries." <br /><br />41: Mage Halciet <br />"Halciet the Mage was the last one who stood against Anuella. He used a stone <br />called "the Seventh Moon" and fought against Anuella, but the mages among his <br />army began a quarrel over the stone's possession, and Halciet left the force." <br /><br />42: Geimaswald <br />"The mages made a magic circle with the Eyes of Flame and summoned the Wyrm of <br />Thunder, Geimaswald, to attack Anuella. But the Lilipeas lured Geimaswald into a <br />cave and killed it. The leader of the Lilipeas was Selva of the Four Winds." <br /><br />43: Eastern Wind <br />"It became known to the mages that these instruments could be used as weapons. <br />The mages took the remaining Eyes of Flame and the instruments acquired in the <br />previous battles and fled to the East. There, the mages made instruments with <br />more Mana power and dedicated them to their new lord, Lonway." <br /><br />44: Emperor Lonway <br />"The mages provided Lonway with their magic, and urged him to prepare for battle <br />with the Faeries. Lonway's army then progressed to the ancient city of Mindas to <br />open the gates to the land of Faeries. Many nations used this as an excuse to <br />start their own political battles." <br /><br />45: Ricrot IV <br />"Ricrot IV was supported by Anuella, and was given an army of wooden horses that <br />could fly in the sky to fight against Lonway and his mages. He came to be known <br />as the "King of Wooden Horses." Many brave men enlisted in Ricrot's army." <br /><br />46: Spiritual War <br />"Gato Grottoes were Fa'Diel's power nexus, protected by "the Spirits of the <br />Ascetics." Many monks fought as soldiers, and the high priests stopped enemies <br />from other dimensions by sending their spirits to battle. Intense battles <br />between the dimensions and other worlds took place in Gato." <br /><br />47: Rosiotti <br />"Rosiotti was a hero who could pierce a warrior's chest with his arrows from <br />miles away. It was anticipated that his bravery and skills would change the <br />war's outcome. However, he only became Lonway's general because Lonway promised <br />him great rewards." <br /><br />48: The Chase <br />"In the midst of intense battles between Ricrot and Lonway's army, Selva of the <br />Four Winds brought his army of Lilipeas and Flowerlings to fight on Ricrot's <br />side. Lonway then ordered Rosiotti to kill Selva. No one had ever escaped <br />Rosiotti's arrows, and the chase was on." <br /><br />49: Selva <br />"Selva kept commanding his army, while fleeing Rosiotti's never- ending chase at <br />the same time. When Rosiotti finally shot Selva's heart with his arrows, he was <br />surrounded by countless Lilipeas. It was then that Rosiotti was told to become a <br />Wisdom, to walk the same path with them." <br /><br />50: Conjuror Nunuzac <br />"Nunuzac was Lonway's best and the most powerful summoner. He summoned Freymold, <br />the Wyrm of Fire, as Lonway ordered him when the tide of war began to turn <br />against him. Nunuzac kept summoning monsters until Lonway was killed, and he <br />himself became trapped in the dimension on the other side of his magic circle." <br /><br />51: Warrior Olbohn <br />"Another army to join the war was Aion's force of "Creatures of Shadow" from the <br />Underworld. These "Creatures of Shadow," or the Shadoles, caught and threw <br />living people into the Underworld and trapped them there. Olbohn the swordsman <br />went down to the Underworld by himself and defeated Aion." <br /><br />52: Freymold <br />"Freymold, the Wyrm that was summoned by Nunuzac, flew across Fa'Diel and burned <br />Rosiotti's jungle to ashes. Rosiotti raged over this event, and later joined <br />Anuella's force." <br /><br />53: Knight of Truth <br />"Lasdanac was the Holy Knight of Ricrot's army who was taught the "Spell of <br />Truth" by the Faeries. With this spell, he defeated Freymold, but it is told <br />that he later fell to a Faerie's curse." <br /><br />54: The New World <br />"After the war came to an end, Ricrot IV built churches and began compiling "The <br />Book of Divine Guidance." He also established the Academy of Magic with a <br />portrait of the great witch, Anise, inside and summoned her spirit to it. <br />Anuella was displeased by this event." <br /><br />55: Temple of Healing <br />"The temples lost many of their monks and priests as they came under Ricrot's <br />rule. All the male priests were taken and sent to the Academy of Magic as magic <br />researchers, to lessen resistance from the religious organizations." <br /><br />56: Anuella <br />"In the years following the war, Ricrot sent soldiers to capture and kill off <br />the surviving soldiers of Lonway's army, as well as the Faeries, which he called <br />"the Ones with Devilish Powers." Anuella left Ricrot and locked herself into a <br />place named 'The Graveyard of Artifacts.'" <br /><br />57: Mana Stones <br />"The seventh Mana Stone was desired for its Mana power, and it appeared in <br />history many times. Jumis were the first ones to be searched for the possession <br />of the stone. It is said that an uncountable number of Jumis were hunted down <br />and killed for this purpose." <br /><br />58: Dirt <br />"When Jumis were being hunted during the search for the seventh Mana Stone, they <br />died after intentionally lessening the energy flow in their jewel cores. Many <br />Jumis died this way to protect the secret of their clan, and mages began to call <br />them "lumps of dirt" as a result." <br /><br />59: Angels <br />"There was a new movement in the land of Faeries, as Zuf'ben became their leader. <br />The spiritual waves of the two worlds were becoming magnified, and many expected <br />the worlds to become one. Zuf'ben lamented over the humans' corruption, and <br />called upon higher beings for help. Angels answered his prayers." <br /><br />60: Janna <br />"Angels were beings who serve the Goddess, and cannot normally be seen by <br />Faeries or humans. Seven angels chose to reincarnate in the land of Faeries, and <br />they rode on Janna, a ship with its own consciousness." <br /><br />61: Incarnation <br />"In order to control the Janna, the angels decided to reincarnate into Faeries <br />and humans. The reborn angels would lose their memories, until Janna could <br />awaken them." <br /><br />62: Malicious Mind <br />"Zuf'ben rode Janna and searched both Fa'Diel and the land of Faeries to find <br />the seven angels, but humans attacked Janna, afraid of the flying ship. During <br />the attack, the minds of those onboard the ship were tainted with evil." <br /><br />63: Unawakened Angels <br />"The angels transmuted into their human and Faeries forms, but they lost <br />awareness of their true nature, because they could not sense Janna's benevolence. <br />Some of the angels even joined the battle to gain control of Janna. Janna turned <br />to evil, and villainous people gained demands over her." <br /><br />64: Ancient Memories <br />"Even though Janna had not awakened them, six of the seven angels regained their <br />memories. One cried for a fallen friend, one confronted Janna, one crossed <br />swords with a former angel, one heard the guidance of a Wisdom: Six angels' <br />memories were restored, but the seventh would never awaken." <br /><br />65: Seventh Angel <br />"In the dreams of the six angels, a seventh angel appeared. But he did not <br />answer the calls of the others. He was neither human nor Faerie, but a Jumi. <br />Both humans and Faeries had used the Jumi to strengthen their magic in the war." <br /><br />66: Janna's End <br />"The angels gave up on retrieving Janna, and chose to fight for the Jumi. With <br />help from the Wisdoms, they built a ship to confront Janna, and joined the war. <br />The angels defeated the leader of humans and Zuf'ben, who had become an evil <br />Faerie, and sealed Janna in the dimensional gap. Then they remained in Fa'Diel." <br /><br />67: Divine Guidance <br />"As time went by, "the Rule for Peace" which Ricrot started changed to "the <br />Peace for Rule." "The Book of Divine Guidance" was used to propagate the <br />empire's religious and political thoughts, and many "heretics" were hunted down <br />by the empire's army." <br /><br />68: Deathbringer <br />"Irzoile Enaanshalc was the fifteenth emperor of the Enaanshalc Empire, and he <br />was called the Deathbringer. He was a descendant of Ricrot Enaanshalc, a hero in <br />the era of the Faerie War, but his oppressive reign caused the empire's fall." <br /><br />69: Holy Knight <br />"The chivalric code, which Ricrot IV established, produced many legendary heroes <br />in a short time period. Julio Liotte was the most accomplished knight in the <br />empire's army, and thus he was given the title of "Holy Knight," and became the <br />guardian of the empire. The Liotte family passed this title down the line." <br /><br />70: The Halloways <br />"To commemorate the souls of heroes lost during the war, Ricrot IV established <br />shrines to the Mana Goddess, and closed down most of the older temples aside <br />from the one in Gato. The Halloway family was a line of priests, but under the <br />rule of Ricrot's empire, its influence diminished." <br /><br />71: Windcallers <br />"The clan of Windcallers could speak to and control the wind. They live quietly <br />in a village by the base of Norn's Peak, and kept their watchful eyes on any <br />intruders that might disturb their way of life." <br /><br />72: Empire's Fall <br />"Irzoile Enaanshalc desired immortality, and sent his army to retrieve the <br />Dragon Stones which the ancient dragons protected. His attempts failed, and he <br />lost his life as a result. But his overwhelming desire for immortality made <br />Jajara, the bone dragon, choose him to become his dragoon." <br /><!--ä¸“é¢˜å†…å®¹ç»“æŸ--></div>
